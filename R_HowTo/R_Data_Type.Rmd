# R objects and attributes
## Obects

**- Five basic classes of objects: **

**- Character, numberic, integer, complex, logical**

**- The most basic object is a vector**

**- List is an exception, it can contain objects of different classes**

**- Empty vector: vector()**

## Numbers

**- Numbers are treated as numberic objects**

**- NaN represents an undefine value**

## Attributes

**- names, dimnames; dimensions; class; length;**

**- attributes()**

## Vectors and Lists
```{r}
n<-c(0.5,0.6) #numeric
l_1<-c(TRUE,FALSE) #logical
l_2<-c(T,F)
ch<-c("a","b","c") #character
i<-9:29 # integer
complex<-c(1+0i,2+4i)
#Using vector() function
vec<-vector("numeric",length = 10)
#Mixing objects
m1=c(1.7,"a") # character
m2=c(TRUE,2) # numeric
m3=c("a",TRUE) # character
```
**When different objects are mixed in a vector, coercion occurs that every element in the vector is of the same class.**

```{r}
#Exlpicit coercion
x = 0:6
class(x) # integer class
#Convert it into different class
as.numeric(x)
as.character(x)
as.logical(x)
#Nonsensical coersion results in NAS
y=c("a","b","c")
as.logical(y)
as.complex(x)
```

```{r}
#Lists
list1=list(1,"a",TRUE,1+4i)
list1
```

## Matrices

**Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute**
```{r}
m1=matrix(nrow = 2,ncol = 3)
m1
dim(m1)
attributes(m1)
```
**Matrices are contructed column-wise**
```{r}
m2=matrix(1:9,nrow = 3,ncol = 3)
m2
# Created matrices from vectors by adding a dimension attribute
m3=1:10
dim(m3)=c(2,5)
m3
```

```{r}
#cbind() and rbind()
x=1:3
y=10:12
cbind(x,y) #3rows and 2 columns
rbind(x,y) #2rows and 3 columns

```

## Factors

**- Factors represent categorical data.**
**- Factors can be ordered and unordered.**
```{r}
f=factor(c("yes","yes","no","yes","no"))
f
# table() create a frequency table
table(f)
# unclass() break down into an integer vector
unclass(f)
```

**- The order of the leves can be set using the levels argument to factor().**
**- This is important because in linear modeling because the first level is used as the baseline level.**
```{r}
answer=factor(c("yes","yes","no","yes","no"),
              levels = c("yes","no"))
answer
```
## Missing values

**is.na(), is.nan()**
```{r}
x=c(1,2,NA,10,3)
is.na(x)
y=c(1,2,NaN,NA,4)
is.na(y)
is.nan(y)
```

## Data frames

**- DF have a special attribute called row.names()**

**- read.table(), read.csv() create df**

**- convert to a matrix data.matrix()**

```{r}
df=data.frame(itemnum=1:4,
              fruit=c("Strawberry","Bluberry","Apple","Banana"),
              vege=c("Carrot","Avacado","Asparagus","Broccoli"))
df
nrow(df)
ncol(df)
row.names(df)
```
## Names
```{r}
x=1:3
names(x)
# Give the name to each vector element
names(x)=c("foo","bar","norf")
x
names(x)
```
```{r}
# list can also have names
y=list(a=1,b=2,c=3)
y
```
```{r}
# Matrices can have names
m=matrix(1:4,nrow = 2,ncol=2)
# row name and col name
dimnames(m)=list(c("a","b"),c("c","d"))
m
```









## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
